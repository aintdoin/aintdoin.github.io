I am a first-year master student at the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2024 from the [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at USTC. My research interests include large model post-training, test-time scaling and reinforcement learning.
